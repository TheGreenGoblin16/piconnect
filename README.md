# Piconnect
### Bluetooth (BLE) communication between computer and Rapbserry Pi Pico WH
- `piconnect_client.py` runs on the computer. Using `bleak` library.
- `piconnect_server.py` runs on the pico. Using `aioble` library.

Currently it works only on my specific setup, perhaps in the future I would extend it to work on general setups.
